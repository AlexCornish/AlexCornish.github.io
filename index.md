# My Digital History Journals

## Week 1:
- Not much to report in setting up all the parts for this as nothing went wrong, apart from an unrelated blue screen. It's not really related to this course and I couldn't screenshot it, but I googled the error code and determined that it was indicative of processor failure. Update: Computer is completely dead. Had to borrow one from roommate until the new one arrives.

- I don't think I encountered any new terms as I have worked quite a bit with GitHub before.

- The UCLA guide (https://uclalibrary.github.io/slides/tutorial-zotero-intro.html#/) on using Zotero was very helpful in teaching how to use it as I had practically no clue how to use it initially.

- There aren't many failures that could be encountered in this weeks section as it should be very simple if the instructions on the course website are followed properly. Possibly some error involving the the connection between the Zotero desktop and the web browser extension could cause a technological failure. Technological failures would be the most likely kind of failures for this week, followed by human error related failures, which would involve deviating from the instructions, either intentionally through disregarding aspects or improperly reading them, or unintentionally through misunderstanding them.

## Week 2:

### Who pays for work to end up online? 
- Usually academic institutions, who get their funding for projects like this from grants from various foundations and councils. Occasionally, the projects will get funding from straight from academic institutions such as universities.
- Sometimes government departments/ government funded-organisations directly put the work online, like https://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/ , which is a government website run by the National Records of Scotland. 

### Who does the work? 
- In some cases, it seems to be mostly volunteers or through crowdsourcing do the work of transcribing the documents, whilst a couple of paid employees do the work of reviewing the work done by the volunteers and compiling of it all to make it available.  
- Sometimes the work is done by archive and record professionals, but not many places have the resources to afford to pay for them to do this work.

### What are some of the ethical dimensions of doing this work? 
- The bulk of the work is done by unpaid volunteers or in some cases, people made 0.05$ per amount of text transcribed, whilst presumably whoever is in charge of the project, gets both paid and the bulk of the credit for the project.       
- Possible exploitation of volunteers in terms of asking them to do more than they initially signed up for. 

### Does Carleton give you any resources for getting those materials onto your own machine in formats you can read? 
- Initially, I had no idea of where I'd find these resources. However, upon further reflection, it became obvious that these resources would be available through the Macodrum Library's online portal and through searching their site, links to various subject's databases (https://library.carleton.ca/find/databases/subjects) and other documents through the regular search. 

### What are some of the barriers to accessing the resources that Carleton does make available to you? 
- The main barrier that I can think of is that I had no idea that these resources were available to me through Carleton, so maybe the lack of publicity to the students about this is a problem or it could just be a lack of awareness on my part. 

### Where do you fit into this digital history machine? 
- In the development of the technology used in digital history, most likely as I am currently working in Artificial Intelligence, albeit for different purposes than digital history, and I have a strong technical background.

## Week 3:

### Decisions made as material is cleaned and transformed. 
- Decisions made based on very little information, for instance, it is possible that you might end up with two possible values for something and have to make a guess as to which one is correct. For example, if in cleaning the data, you end up with an equal number of "Henry Jones" and "Henri Jones", assuming they must be the same person in this instance, you must decide based of very little evidence which one is correct, as the alternative is manually checking these entries and all others like this which is time consuming.
- Another decision includes whether to accept some of the resulting material made by the machine as being correct in the first place, in order to avoid the time-consuming process of manually checking, as you can't be certain without this that the machine has read it entirely correctly. 
- Decisions made based on if certain things are related or not, for instance, in this weeks work there are multiple entries that contain the last name "Jones" and there is also entries with the label "Secretary of State of Texas [Jones]", in instances such as these a decision must be made based on whether or not any of the Joneses mentioned in the material are the Jones who was the Secretary of State of Texas.  In this instance, I chose not match this entry with any of the Joneses as Jones is a relatively common surname and without further research into the full name of the Secretary of State, it wouldn't be certain that it would be matched to the right turn. This decision making along with the aforementioned decision making highlights some of the issues that lie within digital history as a lot of the work required for projects involving digital history requires human input at almost every stage, mainly at the accuracy / fact checking stage, if that is done, which is work that would be presumably done by the "lower level", for lack of a better term, participants, who would presumably receive little to no recognition or remuneration for all of their hard work. 

### What is the value of/for historians (regular historians) showing their work, as opposed to, or in contrast to, what digital historians have to do? 
- Generally, in academia showing your work is an important process to display how you got from where you started to how you reached your conclusion. Furthermore, showing your work makes it easier for other academics / historians to trace your work to either build on it or critise it. In contrast, for digital historians, there isn't much work to show in some instances as some work is done mostly by computers; however, even in the work that was done for this week, there is still a perceivable process that can be followed to determine how certain points were reached. With digital history, it is even possible to show more of your work then with the work done by regular historians, for example you could screen record the entire process. 
- Hypothetically, in recording all of the work done on the screen by the computer and the digital historian, it would be possible to see the entire process unfold, with the viewer being able to stop the video, analyse what the digital historian who recorded it did, and either try to replicate it if they would like to try it out themselves or to try and understand what is being done. 
- However, with computational processes such as the OCR program, there really isn't much to see whilst it is operating and from the outside, unless you understand the technology inside the program and exactly how it does what it does, the work done by the machine cannot be show, all you can see is what naterial the program received to work with and what the result of it was. 

### Where is the scholarly value in showing your work?
- I assume the scholarly value in showing your work is the traceability of it meaning that if someone takes all the same steps as you in performing a set of actions on some material, they should be able to replicate your results or reach the same conclusion from your hypothesis in order to check its accuracy / validity. Presumably the scholarly value comes from the ability to prove that the conclusion you reached is valid, which can only be done if the steps that were taken to reach the conclusion are known.

### Contrast this with how you’ve written history to date.
- Aside from citing sources used in my written history, I can't really say I have any examples of showing my work. 

## Week 4:

### What is missing from historical argumentation in digital history? 
  - Some kind of middle-ground, you can look at the broader trends from afar and a select few close-up reads, but there is still the possibility of missing something there. I'm not really sure how to explain it, but if data is being examined in this way, only looking at the trends, there's a chance to miss the outliers that can indicate otherwise, or tell a different story. As with most of this weeks examples, emphasise was put on the quantity of reoccurences of terms and phrases, although other narrative might be found by looking into instances that deviate from the trends as that could possibly indicate something else. 
  - Personally, I'd say that the studying of the outliers is equally important as studying broader trends as whilst outliers can lead to whole new avenues of perspective and investigation, the broader trends help to give a baseline understanding of the subject against which the outliers can be compared to visualise the deviation between them. As shown in my favourite of this week's reading's "Big Data for Dead People" (That is a fantastic title), where the investigation into Sarah Durrant initially seems to be an outlier with aspects of her trial being rather peculiar for the time, such as the usage of certain terms ("Detective", "Plea Bargaining") and new judicial methods. However; in investigating this possible outlier, it comes to light that it is more indicative of the changing tides in the British Judicial system, which can be seen from the microscope-like view of her case and the analysis of the transcripts, and from the macroscopic level in analysing the wider trends. 

### What is different about this process from what you have come to experience as historians in other classes? 
- Usually in other classes, at least the ones that I have taken, the historical process, begins and ends with the usage of primary documents that have been typed up / scanned from various sources. The extent of the work done to use documents in digital history is greater, but compared to regular documents, a lot more can be done with them a lot easier, by getting the machine to do all the work, albeit at the expense of accuracy.

### How do the particular affordances of digital work change what you might know - and how you might argue it? 
- The affordances, for this instance, what you have access to, can obviously alter what you know. For instance, in the accessing of the newspapers using the Chroncling America database, I was able to notice something relating to the topic I had chosen as I have a decent knowledge of the topic and specifically the newspapers relating to that topic. My topic was Wyatt Earp and to my knowledge, the town of Tombstone, where the notorious gunfight at the O.K Corral took place had 2 competiting newspapers, the Epitaph and the Nugget, and each of them had opposing political stances, stances on the events that took place there, and the people involved in them; however, only the pages of the Tombstone Epipath are available online, giving a one-sided perspective on events. This is something that digital historians need to be aware of, is that a lack of information or having information from only a select number of sources or in some cases a single source can lead them down the wrong path or at least a path of misinformation. Limited access to information changes what you might know, and its difficult the argue against it, but it most probably means that the historians need to be more critical of the information in instances such as these. 

### How much (or what) prior knowledge is a requirement for digital history arguments to make sense to a reader##/viewer/user?
- At least a baseline level of prior knowledge is probably a requirement for digital history arguements to make sense to the user as in some of the abstraction of data, the graphs / charts / other visual mediums can be a bit overwhelming, especially with corpus which might just look like a mass of random words without any context provided for them. Although, having visual mediums like this be used without prior knowledge might be for the better as it might catch the user's interest by allowing them to search the visualised data, discovering the links, and allowing them to investigate for themselves.

## Week 5:

### What you found intriguing, compelling, and effective about the various sites and projects you explored this week. 

- Out of everything, the most interesting piece that I read this week was easily "Songs of Ottawa". Particular parts of this essay that I found compelling was the why Data Sonification that elaborates on the history of the subject and makes it easier to understand what the meaning of it actual is, especially with comparisons to real world examples like ticks of a clock, or that whirring noise made by Geiger Counters. Also, this piece maked me understand why sonification would be more engaging to a data user than just regular data or charts, which I wasn't able to think of myself. 
- However, I did really enjoy the digital panopticon with its visualisation tools that in a way serve the same purpose as sonification, to make the data more engaging to the user. 

### With regard to your own work, reflect on your design choices and the story you’re trying to tell, or the interesting thing you’ve found. Then critically evaluate the thing(s) you’ve made
- SONIFICATION: Not really sure what to make of it, I get that it is more engaging than looking at data, but I feel that so much information is lost in the process that I'm not sure what to make of what I'm hearing. Also this kind of representation wouldn't work as well for people with bad hearing, which might be something to consider in terms of accessiblity of digital history. However, what I've made is probably the nicest sounding thing that I came up with in about 30 minutes of trying different setting and in what it sets out to do, which is show the number of confirmed cases of Coronavirus, it does indeed demonstrate were there are increases and decreases.
- POSTER: I don't like my poster, other than having the events portrayed in a circular fashion with arrows from one section to another indicating a passage of events and I'm somewhat happy with the level of information it provides. Aside from that I can't find any positives about it, I couldn't get the pictures to be consistently sized, nothing is lined up properly, and in retrospect the colour scheme looks like an RV from the '70s. 
- STATIC WEBSITE (https://alexcornish.github.io/): I understand that the style of the website might not be for everyone, but I quite like it. Although I do concede a point made by my partner that I'll discuss later regarding eyes. 

### Show the things you've made to someone outside the class. Did they understand the point you were trying to make? What was effective, for them, and what was confusing?
- I showed / played the sonification for my partner as she found it confusing, in fact, whilst I was working on this I was doing so with the volume playing out loud from my laptop and she was really confused as to how this was digital history or how this was related to what I was supposed to be doing, so obviously context needs to be provided before playing this for anyone as it's just a random series of notes that don't sound that good together. Even with context, she didn't really understand the purpose of it. 
- After that I showed her the poster, which she liked, as it was about Tombstone and her dad lives a very short distance away from it, but when I asked her about the presentation, she said that she liked it, although it could have been styled better as it kind of looks like the poster for the film Vertigo. The original version was brown and orange, but after some advice from her I changed it to orange and silver, which looks rather nice, and I edited the information on it, pairing it down to, what is in my opinion, a good amount for a poster. 
- As for the website, she liked the simplistic style of it, althought she, quite rightly, said that it would probably give you a headache if you looked at it too long.
